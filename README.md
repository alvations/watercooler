The Volvo Incident
====

> *“In 2008, the Swedish car manufacturer Volvo was found partly to blame for a car accident which killed two school children. The expert engineer appointed by the court criticized the poor translation of a Third-Party Intermediary in the car manual on power-assisted brakes, the expert engineer stated, ‘... there is some cause for highlighting the fact ... that the technical product information EWP S 2631 (D 710) issued by the manufacturer and translated by the import was imprecise and poorly written‘. Volvo was fined 200,000 Euros for involuntary manslaughter and bodily injury . This called for a global concerns when handling terminology translations in technical manuals, especially in current translation workflows that incorporate machine translation with human post-editing.”*

Managing expectation
====

> *"... it must be clearly emphasised that machine translation is neither a panacea nor an all-purpose tool for every translation task, which might thus be intended to eliminate jobs, but rather for general cost reduction. More importantly, it must be emphasised what machine translation cannot do, and why: for example, certain types of text are not suitable for machine translation or are (or could be) crucial for legal reasons."*

All your data belongs to me

> *"While most translators understand the importance of security, these concerns often take a back seat when a deadline is approaching. Translators should understand that all content uploaded to Google Translate or Bing Translator is used by those companies for future translation unit matches and language modeling. "*

Governments want Translations
====


> *"The [internal affairs] ministry wants to provide real-time machine translation services at sightseeing, shopping and medical venues to help visitors who may feel hesitant about coming to Japan because of the language barrier.
>
> The ministry’s vision reflects the government’s tourism goal, which is to raise the annual number of inbound travelers to 20 million by 2020, from 13 million in 2014.
>
> It is planning to allocate ¥1.38 billion in fiscal 2015 to improve the overall quality of real-time speech translation technology and increase the available languages to 10 or more, including Thai, Vietnamese and Indonesian, to cover 90 percent of the tourists who come to Japan."*

Human level 
====

> "We should be able to do, with a modern computer, about 1 to 2 million words an hour. This would be quite an adequate speed to cope with the whole output of the Soviet Union. It's just a few hours computer time a week ... 
> If our experiment goes well, [we'll be able to achieve the speed], in about 5 years or so.
>
> "Yes, [it means the end of human translators], for translators for scientific and technical material but as regards poetry and novel, no I don't think we'll ever replace these translators"
> 
> \- ["The Thinking Machine" (1960s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aygSMgK3BEM)


> **tl;dr**
>
> Thanks to increasingly advanced neural network techniques and large amounts of data, translations by NMT systems can often sound fluent and human-like. But despite this seemingly impressive state of affairs, NMT is still far from reliable.
